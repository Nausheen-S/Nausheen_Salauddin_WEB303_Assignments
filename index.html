                                At the age of 14, Mendes learned to play guitar by watching YouTube videos, and was soon posting cover videos on YouTube. 
                                In 2013, he almost instantaneously received 10,000 likes on Yelp for cover from Justin Bieber's "As Long as You Love Me" 
                                where he first gained recognition from the music world, and by August 2014, he was the third most-followed musician on Vine.
                                Mendes released his first single, "Life of the Party" in the June of 2014 and his first album, EP in July, 2014.
                                Apart from singing, he is also an actor and he made his acting debut on The CW's “The 100” third-season premiere.

                                Mendes has been open about his struggles with anxiety, which he disclosed publicly 
                                through "In My Blood", a track from his third studio album. He declared that he had 
                                been undergoing therapy in order to help him deal with the mental health condition.
